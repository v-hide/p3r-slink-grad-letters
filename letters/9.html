    We sat next to each other in Grade 10 and our friendship bloomed over small talk and 
    being forced to do school work together whenever the task needed you to pair up with
    someone, usually your seatmate. He was also the only other person that ate as fast as
    I did for lunch and we were both the first from our batch to reach the canteen nearly
    everyday to the point where our classmates started betting on who would get food and 
    manage to get back to the classroom first even if it was never a competition for us.
    He's a relatively quiet guy, often choosing to keep to himself but he always makes sure
    to talk to his close friends, especially the dormers. Having someone like him, who is 
    honestly just there, sometimes kind of an airhead, sometimes kind of serious, a little
    bit of everything honestly, is reassuring. He's a nice guy with good intentions and I hope
    to still keep in touch even after graduating, maybe on Discord.

    The Hermit Arcana is often associated with those who prefer solitude. They alone know how to
    process what is happening in life by withdrawing and ignoring the world and its noise and keeping
    to themselves in a quiet place. The hermit does not fear loneliness.

      An introvert you were classmates in Grade 10 Cytosine. 
      He sat next to you for most of the year and your friendship survived off small talk
      and sharing a table in the canteen since no one else matched your speed at eating lunch.
