    We were classmates in Grade 10 but I never got to know her properly then.
    It was only in Grade 11 when I started talking to her because I remembered
    she once mentioned she plays Persona 5 and other Persona games. The main 
    reason I started talking to her was because I was debating on buying Persona
    3 Reload at the time and she was the only one I decided I could get a second
    opinion from aside from my online friends. Unironically Persona 3 Reload made
    me a better person and made me realize how valuable your own life is especially
    since I was going through tough times in Grade 11. Her simply encouraging me to
    download a game that costed me 3 thousand pesos made such a positive impact on
    my life that I feel obligated to credit her for making my life better. She also 
    became a person I would come to for advice, or anyone I just needed to talk to.
    That itself also made her a great positive influence in my life for giving me real
    advice on life choices. She's a great friend and a great listener with a caring 
    nature without sacrificing her witty humor. Her friends are lucky to have her 
    and I am too.
