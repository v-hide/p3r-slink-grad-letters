    One of, if not the first conversation I had with him was about Honkai Star Rail in
    Grade 10. We share common interests and I grew kind of closer to him in Grade 11 since
    I shared nearly every class with him. He's a chill guy, smart, and silly when he wants
    to be. Sometimes he gets these random enranged stupor when he's upset about something
    and usually, you'd be scared of someone if it happened especially if they start acting
    erratic during that episode but for Max, I can't help but feel amused watching him go
    through that since it happens so often. Sure I feel bad for him when he gets upset at
    something but he usually bounces back so fast after his crashouts and locks in properly
    and it's honestly impressive. I appreciate his company especially during times in Grade
    11 where I mostly isolated myself from the batch so seeing a familiar face even if we were
    not that close to each other back then felt reassuring. What's even more reassuring is that
    he's also going to the same college and same course as I will in college so once again, I 
    will still see his familiar face more often than not and I know I have a friend around me 
    in college in the future.

      An unervingly serious looking guy at the back of the class, 
      who holds strong feelings about anything and everything, usually 
      resulting into an amusingly enranged stupor when upset or offended.
