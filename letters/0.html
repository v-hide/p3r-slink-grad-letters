    "The Fool is young and vulnerable. He has not yet experienced the ups and downs of life, 
    leaving him unaware of the magnitude of life's challenges, as well as the potential he holds.
    The Fool reminds us to recognize the path of personal development within ourselves -- and the 
    stage upon that path where we find ourselves -- in order to energize our movement toward deeper 
    self-realization."

    This interpretation of the Fool Major Arcana in Tarot card reading, in my opinion, perfectly
    encompasses my journey with everyone I've met in Pisay. I was a young and vulnerable 11 year old
    at the start of grade 7 with no idea what Pisay had in store for me and not to mention I had terrible
    self esteem back then. But looking back on my younger self now when I'm a graduating student, really 
    puts things into perspective and makes me realize just how much I've grown as a person. No man is 
    an island, I learned that the hard way when the worst times of my life came during the COVID-19 
    pandemic. But when I finally decided to live my life to the fullest to the best of my ability, 
    I met people and some even greatly changed my entire life course because of one thing they told me.
    <br>
    <br>
    I will forever be grateful for the experiences I've had with this batch and how it has shaped me.
    While I may not be close with a good number of the batch, most of you have made my days just by talking 
    to me randomly or anything. I truly feel like I belonged. I'm lucky to have been batchmates with you all.
    <br>
    <br>
    Maybe this is a farewell to some and that's okay. If fate decides that we will never see each other again, 
    just know that it was an honor to even get to know you in this period of my life. Through you, my life gained
    meaning. So thank you for everything. 
    <br>
    <br>
    It was a great 6 years of my life. I love you Primahuyo.
