    Patrick is a very outgoing person, the peak of what extroverts are. He's mentioned
    that he's made it a goal of his to talk to every person in the batch once and as far 
    as I know, he's succeeded. Sometimes his prescence is overwhelming but his company is 
    very welcomed by nearly everyone I know. He's a charismatic guy who knows just how to 
    stirke up a conversation with anyone he sees. He's also not scared to express his own 
    opinions and speak up about something. In general he's very much of a people person and 
    I envy his ability to constantly socialize with that amount of comfort and energy. He
    also puts in effort in trying to bring eveyrone together to hang out and have fun. While
    sometimes it's kind of a mess, his efforts aren't really wasted because by the end of the day
    everyone mostly had fun. Some people might avoid ever making that many connections in fear
    or losing touch over time but that thought doesn't seem to haunt Patrick. He's often living
    in the moment and always cherishes what is given to him.

    The Fortune Arcana symbolizes fate, luck, fortune and opportunity. However, like a wheel
    of fortune, it reminds you that nothing is permanent. Sometimes you are at your peak, 
    sometimes you are at your lowest but regardless, you must cherish the lessons you get.

      Primahuyo's #1 businessman. Most of the time he's 
      carrying around a bunch of stuff and showing it to our
      classmates to sell it to them to earn a profit.
      He's smart about it too.
