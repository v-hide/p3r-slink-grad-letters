    Since Grade 10, I started having reccuring on-and-off
    crushes on him that stopped in Grade 10, came back in Grade 11 then stopped again then finally
    came back during Grade 12. I guess 3rd time really is the charm. I'm not even particularly sure
    what got me crushing on him back then. I think in Grade 10 I just found him good-looking then it 
    went away because we never really talked. Grade 11 was confusing honestly because it was kind of 
    forced proximity because of Soiree practices but he was a nice guy. I am kind of sad that I only
    really got to know him properly in Grade 12 then we started dating. It has been 8 months since then
    and even now, it doesn't feel real to me that this is happening because I never in a million years
    did I ever think I would actually pull him but here we are now and I love every second of it. Even if
    there were some rough patches and like every normal couple, we had fights, I really am happy that he
    chose to still stick by me even after all of that. I know I'm probably a lot to handle, I have a lot 
    of problems whether I know they exist or not, but I'm glad to have met someone who is there for me 
    no matter what and I hope to be able to always return that favor.

      &quot;I know for a fact, you were there by my side<br>

      The best thing that's ever happened to me. He acts strange sometimes, but it is part of his charm.
      Some of what he says doesn't make sense but it cheers up everyone around him and it's not
      something many people can pull off effortlessly.
