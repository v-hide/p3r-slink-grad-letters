    One of my first concrete interactions with him was when he asked for a 
    whiteboard marker for a Filipino quiz bee during Grade 11. Since then
    I remember wanting to get to know him better since he seemed like a really
    nice person. Thankfully my wish was properly granted in Grade 12. I would 
    say Maher is a good influence to those around him. He's one of those few people
    that you can tell that have no evil bone in their body. From what other people
    have told me, it's rare to see him be mad at someone or something and I see it 
    as proof of his insanely forgiving nature. He doesn't lash out at anyone and
    continues to act like a saint to everyone even if they probably wronged him 
    at some point.

    The Hierophant arcana is commonly associated with religion, often representing
    a spiritual guide, a messenger from the heavens. The card represents someone 
    who will provide you spiritual guidance.

    <p class="ppl-desc arsenal-bold">
      An aspiring religious man who manages to remain normal among his slightly unhinged compamions.
      He is very supportive towards his friends but still acts as an anchor to stop them from doing anything stupid.
