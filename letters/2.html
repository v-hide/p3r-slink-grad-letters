    It feels like I've known her for longer than the 6 years
    I spent in Pisay. I wouldn't say we grew apart during quarantine
    when she found her own friendgroup, but even if the only time we
    properly spent time together after quarantine was for research purposes,
    she is still as kindhearted and caring as before. We're not exactly
    close "close" friends but we're not exactly distant either. She's 
    fun to hangout with considering her witty humor and jokes. Maybe in
    an alternate universe we would have been roommates in the boarding house
    I stayed at for Pisay or roommates in college. I am thankful for everything
    she's done for me, every moment we've spent together chiaking during research
    period, every time we teased each other in our group chat. I truly appreciate
    her existance in my life and I would have been a different person without her
    company and influence. Her constant support for her friends and peers 
    is something that makes her so charismatic and whimsical. She stays true to herself
    and never falters her own values.

    The Priestess Arcana represents human wisdom. It shows the importance of trusting
    your own instincts and symbolizes the power of a divine female.
