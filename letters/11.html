    One of my first friends in Pisay along with Denise. At first he seems like exactly 
    the type of guy you wouldn't want to be friends with because of the number of red
    flags this guy has with his alcohol erm... addiction and all that but I truly 
    appreciate his company. Research took so much toll on me that I really don't think
    me and Denise would survive if we replaced him with any other person in the batch. 
    Jacob was the perfect guy for the job. He would do everything me and Denise couldn't
    and well, all three of us were close friends already since Grade 7 which made finishing
    Research together even more fulfilling. No matter what happens to this guy, he's still
    standing. Literally could get a failing grade and he would still prance around happy
    and uncaring. It's impressive and inspiring how optimistic he is and it's an infectious 
    kind of optimism that people around him are glad to have. In general, Jacob was one of 
    the people who helped me survive Pisay. Sure he's lazy when it comes to acads but he's
    such a good friend. I really appreciate his company and I'm really thankful for everything 
    he did.

      Most people consider him a lazy guy. I agree, but usually
      if you annoy him enough times, he does something albeit mediocre
      and that is good enough.
