    In Grade 10 I survived the school year with having small talk with just anyone I could 
    talk to. Morish was there consistently and basically allowed me to talk his ear off whenever
    I wanted. Sometimes I feel bad because in those 3 years of friendship with him, it's usually
    me talking his ear off and never him talking to me. Sometimes I wondered if I was ever bothering
    him but on the other hand, I'm glad that he's kind enough to just let me talk to himm about
    anything and everything really. He's been such a great friend and I'm so glad to have met him
    and gotten closer to him in my life here in pisay. I hope that even if college has different
    plans for us both, we'll still keep in touch and remain good friends.

    The Star Arcana has to do ultimately with the freedom to be one's self. 
    This card also represents our reason for being, our mission in this lifetime.
    If we let go of the idea that we are supposed to be in control, we can more easily notice and appreciate the synchronicities that are nudging us along.
