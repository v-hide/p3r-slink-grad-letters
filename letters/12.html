    I feel like the first impression most people get of Vincent is that he's weird. 
    And they are right, he's weird but he knows he's weird but his weirdness doesn't
    hurt anyone rather it gives a fresh breath of air from the plastic normalcy everyone 
    else displays. The more you talk to him though, you realize eventually that he has 
    a soft spot for his close friends even if he shows it  by being really sarcastic.
    His weirdness doesn't hurt anyone but to me sometimes it looks like he's morally grey.
    But maybe that's just him being overly logical and not being that much of an empath. 
    I'm glad to have met him and gotten close to him during my final year in pisay. I
    hope that in him I find a lifelong friend.

    The Hanged Man usually indicates a lack of ability to help oneself through independent action.
    This represents a good time to be philosophical. Only those who possess wisdom and patience
    will be able to see through limitations, including possible humiliation, to grasp the inspiring 
    lesson one can gain from such an experience.

      A serious guy who never sugarcoats his words but still
      manages to be comedic with everything his says and does 
      with his friends.
